    "Ans: A database is a structured collection of data that is organized and managed to allow for efficient access, retrieval, and manipulation of data. It serves as a centralized repository for storing and managing structured, semi-structured, or unstructured data.\n",
    "\n",
    "**SQL (Structured Query Language) Databases:**\n",
    "1. **Structure:** SQL databases are structured databases that use a tabular schema consisting of rows and columns to organize and store data.\n",
    "2. **Schema:** SQL databases have a predefined schema that defines the structure and relationships between different tables.\n",
    "3. **Examples:** Examples of SQL databases include MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle, SQL Server, and SQLite.\n",
    "4. **ACID Transactions:** SQL databases typically support ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) transactions, ensuring data integrity and consistency.\n",
    "5. **Scalability:** SQL databases are generally vertically scalable, meaning they can handle increased workload by adding more resources (CPU, memory) to the existing server.\n",
    "\n",
    "**NoSQL (Not Only SQL) Databases:**\n",
    "1. **Structure:** NoSQL databases are non-relational databases that use flexible data models such as key-value pairs, documents, columnar, or graph-based structures to store and manage data.\n",
    "2. **Schema:** NoSQL databases are schema-less or have a dynamic schema, allowing for more flexibility in data storage without predefined schemas.\n",
    "3. **Examples:** Examples of NoSQL databases include MongoDB, Cassandra, Couchbase, Redis, and Amazon DynamoDB.\n",
    "4. **Scalability:** NoSQL databases are generally horizontally scalable, meaning they can handle increased workload by adding more servers to the database cluster.\n",
    "5. **CAP Theorem:** NoSQL databases often prioritize availability and partition tolerance over consistency, adhering to the CAP (Consistency, Availability, Partition tolerance) theorem.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Differences:**\n",
    "- **Data Model:** SQL databases use a structured, tabular data model, whereas NoSQL databases offer a variety of flexible data models.\n",
    "- **Schema:** SQL databases have a predefined schema, whereas NoSQL databases are schema-less or have a dynamic schema.\n",
    "- **Scalability:** SQL databases are typically vertically scalable, while NoSQL databases are horizontally scalable.\n",
    "- **ACID Transactions:** SQL databases support ACID transactions, while NoSQL databases may offer eventual consistency or weaker consistency models.\n",
    "- **Use Cases:** SQL databases are suitable for applications with complex queries and transactions, whereas NoSQL databases are often used for real-time analytics, caching, content management, and handling large volumes of unstructured data.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, SQL databases offer strong consistency and structured data storage, whereas NoSQL databases provide flexibility, scalability, and performance for handling large volumes of diverse data types. The choice between SQL and NoSQL databases depends on the specific requirements and characteristics of the application."

DDL statements are used to create, modify, and delete database objects, thereby defining the database schema.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's a brief explanation of DDL statements and their usage:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **CREATE:** The CREATE statement is used to create new database objects such as tables, indexes, views, or constraints.\n",
    "\n",
    "   Example: Creating a new table named `employees` with columns `id`, `name`, and `salary`.\n",
    "   ```sql\n",
    "   CREATE TABLE employees (\n",
    "       id INT PRIMARY KEY,\n",
    "       name VARCHAR(100),\n",
    "       salary DECIMAL(10, 2)\n",
    "   );\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **DROP:** The DROP statement is used to delete existing database objects such as tables, indexes, views, or constraints.\n",
    "\n",
    "   Example: Dropping the `employees` table.\n",
    "   ```sql\n",
    "   DROP TABLE employees;\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **ALTER:** The ALTER statement is used to modify the structure of existing database objects, such as adding, modifying, or dropping columns in a table.\n",
    "\n",
    "   Example: Adding a new column `department` to the `employees` table.\n",
    "   ```sql\n",
    "   ALTER TABLE employees\n",
    "   ADD COLUMN department VARCHAR(100);\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **TRUNCATE:** The TRUNCATE statement is used to remove all rows from a table, but the table structure and its metadata remain intact.\n",
    "\n",
    "   Example: Truncating the `employees` table to remove all existing data.\n",
    "   ```sql\n",

    "- `mysql.connector.connect()`: This function establishes a connection to the MySQL database server. You need to provide the hostname, username, password, and database name as parameters.\n",
    "- `cursor()`: The `cursor()` method creates a cursor object that allows you to execute SQL queries on the database.\n",
    "- `execute()`: The `execute()` method is used to execute SQL queries. It takes two parameters: the SQL query and optional parameters to be passed to the query. For parameterized queries, you can use `%s` as a placeholder for values.\n",
    "- `fetchall()`: After executing a SELECT query, the `fetchall()` method is used to fetch all the rows returned by the query.\n",
    "- `commit()`: After executing data manipulation queries like INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE, etc., the `commit()` method is used to commit the transaction and make the changes permanent in the database.\n",
    "- `close()`: Finally, the `close()` method is called on both the cursor and the connection objects to close the connection to the database server. It's important to close the cursor and connection when you're done with them to release resources and avoid memory leaks."
